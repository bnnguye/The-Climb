Bill: Welcome to The Climb!
Bill: This game was developed by me, who wanted to play a game with some of my good friends that were into anime, but we couldn't find any.
Bill: So I made one!
Bill: The aim of the game is to reach the top of the Climb.
Bill: In Story Mode, there will be varying levels of Climbs, where players work together to reach the top.......together.
Bill: In VS Mode, players compete against each other on a wide selection of Climbs!
Bill: Alright, let's start now.
Bill: Use controls WASD to move your character.
