Bill: Nice work!
Bill: There's other obstacles that you will encounter throughout your Climbs.
Bill: It gets really difficult later and nearly impossible without any help.
Bill: Now...
Bill: I know a few people that may be able to help you out throughout your Climbs...
Bill: One of them here is right now.
Bill: Let me introduce to you my good friend...
Naofumi: Yo.
Bill: That was Naofumi. He's the Shield Hero from Rising of The Shield Hero.
Naofumi: I heard you were going to attempt The Climb. Pretty dangerous if you ask me.
Naofumi: My shield's kept me pretty handy up to this point.
Bill: This is Naofumi's Shield. It will protect you from obstacles. However, it breaks after one collision.
Bill: I'll spawn one in for you. Grab the shield before it drops.
