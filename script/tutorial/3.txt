Bill: Nice work!
Bill: You're getting the hang of it already.
Bill: There's other obstacles that you will encounter throughout your Climbs.
Bill: Please remember to dodge them to ensure your safety.

Bill: There are also powerups that you can collect in your Climbs.
Bill: Take this one for example.
Bill: This is Naofumi's Shield. It will protect you from obstacles. However, it breaks after one collision.
Bill: I'll spawn one in for you. Grab the shield before it drops.
