Mai: Where am I…?
Asuna: Mum! He is finally awake. Mum!
Mai: Who-who are you?
Nino: My name is Nino. I found you unconscious in the forest while I was looking for herbs. What happened to you? What is your name?
Mai: I..
Mai: I dont know. I cant remember. All I remember was that I was climbing, then a moment later, my life flashed before my eyes. My head feels very sore.
Nino: Climbing? My, you must be very courageous. The only climb nearby that you could have been attempting was Climb A. Anyways, youre very lucky to have survived the fall. It seems that you were saved by the trees.
Mai: How long was I asleep for?
Nino: About 7 days.
Mai: 7 DAYS? Where is…..
Nino: ? Was someone with you? When I found you, I didnt see anyone else nearby. Do you know who you were with?
Mai: I-I don’t know. My head hurts thinking about it.
Nino: How about you get some rest while I make you some porridge. Itll only take a while.
Mai: Okay.
Mai: Nino leaves. You go back to sleep.
