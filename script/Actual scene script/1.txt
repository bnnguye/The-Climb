Nere/Celestine wake up in an unfamiliar room.
Nere: *groans*
Nere: Where are we?
???: In my room!
Celestine: Huh?
Nothing: Celestine sits up, and finds a little girl angrily pouting in front of her.
???: You're in my bedroom!
Celestine: …
Celestine: My head hurts.
???: Mum! They’re awake!
Nothing: The girl leaves.
Nothing: Celestine throws a glance at Nere, hoping for answers. 
Nothing: Nere shrugs.
The little girl comes back with someone.
Marianne: How are you two feeling? My gosh, you’ve been asleep for so long.
Marianne: I was afraid you two were going to die in a coma.
Nere: Where are we right now?
Mariam’s Mum: A cottage not too far away from Town A.
Celestine: Who are you?
Marianne: Now now, there's more than enough time to catch up.
Marianne: I've made some porridge so come downstairs when you're ready to eat and then we'll talk later.
Nothing: Marianne leaves the room.
Nothing: Mariam follows her.
