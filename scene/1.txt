Mai: Where am I…?
Asuna: Mum! He is finally awake. Mum!
Mai: Who-who are you?
Nino: My name is Nino. I found you unconscious in the forest while I was looking for herbs. What happened to you? What is your name?
Mai: I..
Mai: I don’t know. I can’t remember. All I remember was that I was climbing, then a moment later, my life flashed before my eyes. My head feels very sore.
Nino: Climbing? My, you must be very courageous. The only climb nearby that you could have been attempting was Climb A. Anyways, you’re very lucky to have survived the fall. It seems that you were saved by the trees.
Mai: How long was I asleep for?
Nino: About 7 days.
Mai: 7 DAYS? Where is…..
Nino: ? Was someone with you? When I found you, I didn’t see anyone else nearby. Do you know who you were with?
Mai: I-I don’t know. My head hurts thinking about it.
Nino: How about you get some rest while I make you some porridge. It’ll only take a while.
Mai: Okay.
Mai: Nino leaves. You go back to sleep.
Mai: You wake up, open the door. You can smell herbs underneath so you go downstairs.
Nino: It seems that you’re awake.
Mai: Thanks for taking care of me. But I don’t want to burden you any further. I must take my leave.
Nino: Come sit and eat the porridge I prepared earlier while you were sleeping. You’ll need it if you’re going anywhere. Before you go, I must make sure that you’re self-sufficient enough to take care of yourself.
Mai: After eating… you follow Marilyn outside.
